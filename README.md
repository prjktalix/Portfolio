Hello! I'm a UCSC student majoring in Computer Science Game Design, set to graduate in Spring 2024. Being a Game Designer has equipped me with technical skills, creative problem-solving, and team leadership - skills that I believe are fundamental to successful product management.

I thrive on the logic of C, C#, and C++, the structure of HTML, the style of CSS, and the dynamics of JavaScript. My academic pursuits in game design have not only honed my technical skills but also sharpened my creative instincts, allowing me to envision and create engaging digital experiences. 

Sound Design is where I mix my love for tech with creativity. Working on group projects with Pure Data and Metasounds, I've learned the art of enhancing user experiences through sound, a skill that translates into understanding and enhancing user engagement in product management.

What gets me going is leading a team. Guiding a group towards a common vision and celebrating our collective success is what I find most rewarding. I'm all about making the tough calls, owning project completion, and keeping the team-driven and focused.

In my role as a Process Assistant at Amazon, I played a crucial role in operational efficiency and enhancing team performance. Orchestrating sorting processes and managing resources effectively has given me an insight into optimizing workflows. I effectively managed and distributed headcount, which was instrumental in achieving one of the highest Throughput per Hour (TPH) rates of 104 on my shift. My daily duties also involves conducting stand-ups to align and a diverse team of 50-200 associates with operation goals, thereby boosting productivity. This echoes the responsibilities of leading cross-functional teams in a product management. roles.I also took pride in mentoring and training new Process Assistants and associates aspiring to advance, fostering an environment that emphasized professional development and continuous learning. 

Lately, my interest in product management has grown. I'm fascinated by the prospect of guiding a product's lifecycle from conception to launch, ensuring it not only meets user needs but also exceeds expectations. My blend of technical background, design sensibility, and leadership experience position me well for this role.

I'm actively seeking internships and opportunities where I can show my diverse skill set in a product management role, whether it's leading a tech team, overseeing a game's release, or delving into project/program management.

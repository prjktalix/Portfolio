Hello! I am Brian, a UCSC student expecting to graduate in Spring 2024. I am majoring in Computer Science Game Design, where I can show my creative side by creating a functioning, fun game. My college was about teamwork, tackling design challenges, and bringing game concepts to life. I thrive on the logic of C, C#, and C++, the structure of HTML, the style of CSS, and the dynamics of JavaScript.

Regarding Microsoft Office, I excelled in presentations in PowerPoint, managing spreadsheets in Excel, and drafting detailed documents in Word. 

Sound Design is where I mix my love for tech with creativity. Working on group projects with Pure Data and Metasounds, I've seen firsthand how the right sound can transform a gaming experience.

What gets me going is leading a team. There's something gratifying about guiding a group of talented individuals toward a shared vision and crossing the finish line together. I'm all about making the tough calls, owning project completion, and keeping the team driven and focused.

I'm also proud to have been the force behind initiatives that have made our workplaces better—believing firmly that a happy team is a productive team. I've always aimed to create environments where collaboration is the key.

Lately, my interest in product management has grown. I'm fascinated by the prospect of guiding a product's lifecycle from conception to launch, ensuring it not only meets user needs but also exceeds expectations. Merging my technical background, design sensibility, and leadership experience, I'm eager to explore how to contribute to product strategy and development.

I'm currently on the lookout for internships and/or opportunities where I can blend my diverse skills—whether that's leading a tech team, orchestrating a game's release, or diving into product management.

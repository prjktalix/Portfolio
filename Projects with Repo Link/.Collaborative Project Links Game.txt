	-  I worked on a quick prototype of a maze. I am the lead designer and programming of this project. My responsibilities 
		include creating a maze, setting up the prefabs, and creating AI behavior by tracking/following the player. 
		Additionally, I implemented the navigation mesh, and created a win/lose condition which is one of the most 
		important factors of the game. For a better player experience, I managed the camera and player behavior, 
		ensuring a smooth interaction throughout the game.
